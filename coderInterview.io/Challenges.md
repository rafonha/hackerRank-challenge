HackerRank challenge with JavaScript

## 1. Add two numbers to reach target
Given an array of integer numbers that are already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. 

Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2,
where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [1,2] Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

## 2. Find words on string
You are given an array of words ["cat", "bob", "foo", "baby", "car"] and an array of random strings ["zDWaeecjpot", "atrfbnoaoqoqob", "bbbewqway", "efwecarqwef"]. Write a function that takes two arguments, word (string) and random (string), and returns whether word is contained in random.

Example: zDWaeecjpot-> contains cat atrfbnoaoqoqob -> contains foo and bob bbbewqway -> contains baby efwecarqwef -> contains car

Note: the random string should contain all instances of word characters, for example for "bob", the random string must have 2x the letter "b", in any order.
